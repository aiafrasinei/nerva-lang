```nerva
com_i

id_i = 330

id = 331

str_s = "text"

a_i

a_i = 3

nr_r = 0.1

a = a + 1

hello_s = "Hello World"
hello = "Hello World!"
```

## camel case

```nerva
newVariable_i = 0
```

## notes

* _ cant be used in variable name (just type definition)
* A variable declaration is mandatory to use type annotation
* After declaration variables are accessed by just using the name
